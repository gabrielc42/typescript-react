# typescript-react
notable:
  - react
  - typescript
  - redux
  - lerna
 
includes: 
  - code editor web app similar to codepen, in progress
    - working with various packages
    - custom scripts
  - a package search web app built with React-Redux
  - typescript parent/child working practice and template

biggest challenges:

  - learning typescript throughout project
  - project breaking moments with 3rd party installations & directories, react/esbuild installation issues followed
  - not doing 'lerna add' rather than npm installs post-lerna, thus requiring a manual rebase of the project (rather than the labyrinth of manuevering node_modules and reinstalling npm installs with lerna at that point)
